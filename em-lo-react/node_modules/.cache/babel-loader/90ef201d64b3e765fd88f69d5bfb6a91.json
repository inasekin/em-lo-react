A UPVC window lock is a conventional designation of several limiters installed to fix the window sash in a certain position. The installation of such devices allows the opening of windows for daily ventilation but prevents children from falling outside, going out onto the cornice or balcony. The locks are fixed to any type of frame, consisting of plastic, wood, at the same time, their installation is possible both on already installed and on new window systems.</p>'+'<p>The main function of window locks is to protect the child. The kid will not be able to open the sash without a key, which excludes a fall.</p>'+'<p>Choosing locks for plastic windows, you should take into account the features of the window structure, its size and type of opening. Many manufacturers produce devices in a variety of colours, which allows you to choose the most appropriate option according to the colour of the window frame and the design of your home.</p>'+'<h2 class=\"block-title\">When do you need to replace the window hardware?</h2>'+'<p>Window fittings are the most important elements of any window.

Wear is also affected by improper installation and lack of maintenance.
